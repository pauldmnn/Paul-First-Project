                <p>Romania's natural world is arguably one of Europe's last true wilderness areas. Old-growth forests
                    blanket vast mountain ranges that stretch across the country. They offer refuge for European
                    wildlife in an otherwise densely populated and highly developed continent. Wolves, bears, and lynx
                    all thrive here.</p>

                <h2>About Romania</h2>

                <h3>See below a short description of Romania's history and geography</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The territory of Romania has been inhabited since the Paleolithic period.
                    Present-day Romania was first inhabited by the Dacians, fierce warriors, subdued by the Romans under
                    Emperor Traian in two extremely difficult campaigns at the beginning of the 2nd century AD. The
                    relatively brief Roman occupation, 165 years, nevertheless left us a lasting legacy, the Latin
                    language, which survived many subsequent invasions of migratory peoples. Over the years, a Romanian
                    identity progressively developed.

                    During the 13th and 14th centuries the feudal states of Walachia and Moldavia were established.
                    Centuries of struggles against the Turks ensued in these states. Meanwhile, Transylvania was
                    successively occupied by the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires. Finally, Moldavia and Wallachia
                    were united in 1859, Independence was achieved in 1877 and the Unification with Transylvania in
                    1918.

                    The communist regime, established after World War II, lasted 45 years and was ended by the
                    Revolution of December 1989.
                    Romania became member of NATO in 2004 and since 2007 Romania is a member of the European Union.</p>

                <h4>Geography</h4>
                <p>Romania is situated in Southeast Europe between latitudes 43°37' 07" and 48º15' 06" north and
                    longitudes 20°l5' 44" and 29°42' 24" east - extending approximately 480 km north to south and 640 km
                    east to west. The country has an area of 237,750 km2 and a population of almost 20.000.000
                    inhabitants of which 89% are Romanians, 6.5% Hungarians, 3.3% Romani, as well as Germans, Slovaks,
                    Turks, Russians, Bulgarians, Croats, Tatars, Czechs, Greeks, Jews, Armenians, Polish, Albanians. The
                    Carpathian Mountains are situated in the center of the country, bordered on both sides by hills and
                    plateaus and finally the Great Plains of the outer rim. Forests cover over a quarter of the country
                    and the fauna is one of the richest in Europe including wolves, bears, deer, lynxes and chamois.

                    The mighty Danube forms the southern boundary of the country
                    ending in the Danube Delta at the Black Sea, a heavenly home for countless, native and migratory
                    birds.

                    Countries sharing borders with Romania are Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine.</p>
