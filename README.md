[Link to a live site](https://pauldmnn.github.io/Paul-First-Project/)

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS.

With this project i want to show people different beautiful places from Romania which i have visited through the years. 

Users will be able to navigate through the website using a functional navigation bar which will take the user to three different sections of the web-site. On the home page the user will be able to read about Romania and why visit Romania. There is a Photo section where I have included some photos from Romania. I have created a Feedback section which will allow the user to complete a form and submit feedback. 

#### Thank you for visiting Romania

## UX - User Experience Design

In the course I was taught about the User Experience Design and the importance of it. 
Below I have listed the 5 plains of UX: 

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## The Strategy Plane

### Creator Goals

- I want webpage to be easy to navigate.
- I want webpage to be a user-friendly and responsive.
- I want users to be able to see what the site is about immidiately (on a home page).
- I want users to be motivated to leave feedback after visiting a webpage.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to navigate across the site to see different pages on a webpage.
- As a user, I want the purpose of a webpage to be clear so I can decide if the content is right for me.
- As a user, I want to see the photos in the website.
- As a user, I want to be able leave feedback and read about Romania in the website.

## The Scope Plane

I thought of the features I wanted to implement before designing the project, and a few of them were not achievable within my deadline. I decided to implement the ones covering my user stories first and add the remaining features later.

**Features implemented upon webpage release**

- Home Page with an introduction about Romania with some history and geografy about Romania.
- Functional navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages.
- Photos page will allow useres to see different photos from Romania
- Feedback page will allow users to leave feedback about Romania
- Footer with links to social media.
